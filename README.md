Background:
In a world where vast amounts of laptop comparison websites exist, we wanted to create and deploy an app that would narrow down results according to more specific needs.

We started off by web scraping two popular laptop websites, Fry's Electronics and Best Buy. After scraping all of the laptops offered on each website, the data was put into a Postgres database. This database was then used to create price charts, a table with filtering options and a map showing where the consumer can purchase each laptop. After creating and analyzing the data, an HTML was created to display all our charts and tables. After completing the HTML we linked everything to a Heroku server to launch the application.
